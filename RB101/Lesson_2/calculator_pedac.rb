# P
#   - Build a terminal 4 func. calculator that takes 2 numbers from the user,
#     the operation being performed, and then displays the result
#   - Inputs: 2 numbers, operation performed
#   - Outputs: display of the calculation performed
#
# E
#   - x/0 will result in a zerodiv error
#   - 0/x (as long as x isn't 0) will result in 0
#   - 5/10 = 2
#   - 5 * 10 = 50
#
# D
#   - No DS will be used, instead conditionals and variables will be used to 
#   - get input and display output
#
# A
#   - Start: Display greeting to user and explain what program does
#   - Obtain first int value from user and set as num1
#   - Obtain second int value from user and set as num2
#   - Ask user what operation they would like to perform
#   - Display possible operation choices
#   - Obtain operation choice from user and set as operation_choice
#   - Set variable result to conditional to perform calc. dependent
#     on variable values
#   - Display #{result}
