// Implement a function that performs basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string "aabcccccaaa" would become "a2b1c5a3". If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your function should return the original string.

// javascript

console.log(compressString("aabcccccaaa")); // "a2b1c5a3"
console.log(compressString("abcdef")); // "abcdef"
