# # Implement a function, capitalize, that capitalizes all words in a sentences. 
However, only capitalize if the word is followed by a word starting with a vowel 
(for Ruby donâ€™t use capitalize). 

# # Test cases
# puts capitalize("hello apple world") # "Hello apple world"
# puts capitalize("this is an umbrella") # "This Is An umbrella"
# puts capitalize("every vowel starts an echo") # "every vowel Starts An echo"
# puts capitalize("under the oak tree") # "under The oak tree"
# puts capitalize("a quick brown fox") # "a quick brown fox

- beginning: string
- mieddle: use array to iterate over entire sentence, check words and chars, apply modifications
- ending: modified string

- SPLIT the string into an array of words
- TRANSFORM the string by ITERATING over each element where
  - if the next words first character starts with aeiou?
    - upcase the first letter in the current word
  - otherwise just return the normal word
- JOOIN the array back into a string
