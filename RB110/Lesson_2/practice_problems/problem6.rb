One of the most frequently used real-world string properties is that of
"string substitution", where we take a hard-coded string and modify it with
various parameters from our program.

Given this previously seen family hash, print out the name, age and
gender of each family member:
(Name) is a (age)-year-old (male or female).

munsters = {
  "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
  "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
}

munsters.each do |key, value|
  puts "#{key} is a #{value["age"]}-year-old #{value["gender"]}!"
end
