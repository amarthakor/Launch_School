What are the benefits of using Object Oriented Programming in Ruby? 
Think of as many as you can.

# Mine
- OOP allows us to write more DRY code by consolidating and reusing portions of code
- OOP allows us to create more flexible code 
- OOP allows us to encapsulate, or section off, chunks of code to better help organize
  and structure our code
- OOP allows polymorphism in many different forms, which allows us to have different data types
  respond to the same method invocation, and this can result in similar or different results
- OOP allows us to create inheritance via class inheritance or interface inheritance through
  mixed in modules. This gives our code greater flexibility and can reduce the amount of code

# Additional
- Creating objects allows programmers to think more abstractly about the code they are writing.
  This can be reflected by a higher level, more real world language approach, such as using 
  nouns and verbs to explain objects / method definitions, which make structuring code more 
  sensical
- Objects are represents by nouns, so that they are easier to conceptualize
- It allows us to only expose functionality to the parts of code that need it, meaning namespace
  issues are much harder to come across. This works by making specific methods only accessable
  to parts of code that we want, therefore we can include methods of the same name that 
  repsond differently.
- We can build applications faster as we can re use code (DRY) that has already been written.
- As the software grows and becomes more complex over time, we can more easily manage the
  complexities of the code.
