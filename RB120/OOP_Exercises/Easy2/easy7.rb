Consider the following code:

butterscotch = Pet.new('cat', 'Butterscotch')
pudding      = Pet.new('cat', 'Pudding')
darwin       = Pet.new('bearded dragon', 'Darwin')
kennedy      = Pet.new('dog', 'Kennedy')
sweetie      = Pet.new('parakeet', 'Sweetie Pie')
molly        = Pet.new('dog', 'Molly')
chester      = Pet.new('fish', 'Chester')

phanson = Owner.new('P Hanson')
bholmes = Owner.new('B Holmes')

shelter = Shelter.new
shelter.adopt(phanson, butterscotch)
shelter.adopt(phanson, pudding)
shelter.adopt(phanson, darwin)
shelter.adopt(bholmes, kennedy)
shelter.adopt(bholmes, sweetie)
shelter.adopt(bholmes, molly)
shelter.adopt(bholmes, chester)
shelter.print_adoptions
puts "#{phanson.name} has #{phanson.number_of_pets} adopted pets."
puts "#{bholmes.name} has #{bholmes.number_of_pets} adopted pets."


Write the classes and methods that will be necessary to make this code run, and print the following output:

P Hanson has adopted the following pets:
a cat named Butterscotch
a cat named Pudding
a bearded dragon named Darwin

B Holmes has adopted the following pets:
a dog named Molly
a parakeet named Sweetie Pie
a dog named Kennedy
a fish named Chester

P Hanson has 3 adopted pets.
B Holmes has 4 adopted pets.


The order of the output does not matter, so long as all of the information is presented.

- Pet class instantiate object with 2 arguments, pet type and pet name
- OWner class isntantiate object with 1 argument, owner name
- Shelter class instantiate object with no arguments
- Shelter instance method #adpot takes 2 arugments, owner class object and pet class object
- Shelter instance method #print_adoptions prints all owners and the pets they adopted
  - maybe consider hash; key is owner value is array of pets they adopted?
- Owner class must have access to read name and number of pets 
  - probably attr_reader :name, number_of_pets
