A circular buffer is a collection of objects stored in a buffer that 
is treated as though it is connected end-to-end in a circle. When an 
object is added to this circular buffer, it is added to the position 
that immediately follows the most recently added object, while removing 
an object always removes the object that has been in the buffer the longest.

This works as long as there are empty spots in the buffer. If the buffer 
becomes full, adding a new object to the buffer requires getting rid of 
an existing object; with a circular buffer, the object that has been in 
the buffer the longest is discarded and replaced by the new object.

Assuming we have a circular buffer with room for 3 objects, the 
circular buffer looks and acts like this:

P1	P2	P3	Comments
All positions are initially empty
1			Add 1 to the buffer
1	2		Add 2 to the buffer
2		Remove oldest item from the buffer (1)
2	3	Add 3 to the buffer
4	2	3	Add 4 to the buffer, buffer is now full
4		3	Remove oldest item from the buffer (2)
4	5	3	Add 5 to the buffer, buffer is full again
4	5	6	Add 6 to the buffer, replaces oldest element (3)
7	5	6	Add 7 to the buffer, replaces oldest element (4)
7		6	Remove oldest item from the buffer (5)
7			Remove oldest item from the buffer (6)
Remove oldest item from the buffer (7)
Remove non-existent item from the buffer (nil)

Your task is to write a CircularBuffer class that implements a circular
 buffer for arbitrary objects. The class should obtain the buffer 
 size with an argument provided to CircularBuffer::new, and should 
 provide the following methods:

put to add an object to the buffer
get to remove (and return) the oldest object in the buffer. It should return nil if the buffer is empty.
You may assume that none of the values stored in the buffer are nil 
(however, nil may be used to designate empty spots in the buffer).

=end

# - When adding object, object is added next to the most recently added object
# - When removing object, always remove oldest object first
# - If buffer is full, have to swap oldest object with newest object
# - Return nil if buffer is empty

# - Need method to add new objects (setter method)
# - Need method to remove AND return objects (setter method); should return nil if buffer is empty
