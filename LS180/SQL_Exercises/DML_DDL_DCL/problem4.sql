Does the following statement use the DDL or DML component of SQL?

ALTER TABLE things
DROP CONSTRAINT things_item_key;

DDL - We are not manipulating data itself, rather a 
      piece of information (constraint) about a table

- Alter TABLE is used to modifiy the characterisitics/ attrivutes of a table
- ALTER TABLE statements are apart of the DDL sublanguage.
