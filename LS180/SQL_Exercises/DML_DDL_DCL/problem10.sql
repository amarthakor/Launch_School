Does the following statement use the DDL or DML component of SQL?

CREATE SEQUENCE part_number_sequence;

DDL - CREATE SEQUENCE statements modify the chars and attrs of a database
      they dont modify any individual data piece, thus it is DDL sublanguage

      - ALL CREATE statements are generally considered DDL subspecific
